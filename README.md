# IML Assignment

## Classification Tasks:

Dataset: 2-dimensional data of 2, 3 or 4 classes:
- Linearly separable data set
- Nonlinearly separable data set
- Overlapping data set

## Classifier to be built :

1. Bayes classifier
2. Perceptron based classifier
3. SVM based classifier

Report should include the results of studies presented in the following each dataset:
1. Plot of training data with mean displayed in different color
2. Classification accuracy, precision for every class, mean precision, recall for every class, mean recall, F-measure for every class and mean F-measure on test data
3. Confusion matrix based on the performance for test data. The entries in confusionmatrix must be made in percentage.
3. Decision region plot for every pair of classes with the respective training data superimposed
4. Decision region plot for all the classes together with the training data superposed
5. Decision region plot for all the classes together with the testing data superimposed
